            In the middle of a casual day, where everyone is doing their activities. At the same time, most of everyone is feeling productive and even more crazy a close friend of mine Nightie has a crazy idea. He says "Let's start a con for our country, a Pony con." Everyone seemed to be pretty interested, even me myself. I was the web and design developer, one of those meta dudes. At the time everything was being set up and planned, I met a girl named Aulia. The first time I see her on chat, I find her lovely and funny. We had a solid 3 to 4 months of preparing and marketing everything about the convention. I feel like I am really getting close to her. It felt wonderful, I've never had such feelings before. At least in a long long time ago. I am still very shy around her, either her to me too. We just chat around in some group chats, we rarely chat around dm's just because both of us isn't that confident to each other just yet.
            <br>
            <br>
            Not long after, the big day has come. The convention starts at the day and it went super awesome, I actually had to meet her and get to talk face to face (not personal stuff, just casual). Just days before the con, she offered me her commission for a keychain and I'm like, "Okay let's go" The price itself is only around 13K plus a sticker for a bonus for another 5K. While the con's ongoing there's apparent misinformation when we're ordering food, I and Aulia didn't get any hence my friend Ferdy had to order another one, with a price of 50K or around. I paid for her food and the shipping cost just because I feel emphatic at that time. She thanked me.
            <br>
            <br>
            The con is coming to an end, everyone is feeling woozy and exhausted but also really happy. We clean the venue after the closing ceremony and it all went great. Well even if some or most of us had an emotional PCD hit. It's normal for such a big day. For the final closing, we went to a restaurant. We ordered some food and chatter and Nightie is... really hitting that PCD. We finished our food and it's time for each of us to get back home, the last goodbye from me to Nightie, and Aulia for the day. It felt a lot different when you know that it's all over.
            <br>
            <br>
            The casual days return after some days of PCD exhaustion. We now occasionally chat in our Telegram Group chat. I and Aulia still chat around.
            <br>
            <br>
            Just after some weeks, I found out that Aulia decided to choose someone else without me noticing much, it is also my close friend. His name is Pradashie, a rainbow dash fanboy. He's a very unique person and we love his silly actions. It just happens to be not the time for me to have a couple, maybe the time is telling me something. I did feel disappointed and down, but I couldn't stop them from being what they want to be. It's their rights. I have to get used to it and it's important to learn more to be rejected.
            <br>
            <br>
            Maybe I was too late to confess that Pradashie already did it first? We never really know, neither myself. And to be honest, I'm actually happy to see Aulia happy again after her past backgrounds. And I'm really impressed to see my silly friend actually got a cute relationship with someone special.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the end, none's lost, we both are still happy. One for the memories, one for a new bond.
